# FiveM_Core_Scripts
Hello, I found this on my PC but don't know where and who made it. I don't know if I did it, I have to say. Well, here - will definitely be useful for one or the other!

If you want to use the scripts, you have to create a folder in the script called "client" and put all scripts except fxmanifest.lua and config.lua in it
